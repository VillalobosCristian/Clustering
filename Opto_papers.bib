The inferred interfacial flow velocities reach values of up to 300 μm=s and set up a parabolic flow field in the water film at large distances from the heat source. The slip velocities are found to be much stronger at interfaces covered with nonionic block-copolymers as compared to bare charged glass interfaces. The good agreement of the numbers gathered in Table 1 leads us to the conclusion that the slip velocity on a Pluronic-coated surface is driven by thermo-osmosis on the PEG-water interface. More generally, they confirm the role of the interaction enthalpy for the thermal separation of molecular mixtures [41] and suggest that simple models such as Eq. (4) provide a good description for the Soret data of polymers. Regarding the thermo-osmosis on a glass surface, our findings differ from previous results. The discrepancy probably results from additional contributions to the excess enthalpy, such as structuration of water or rearrangement of the hydrogen bond network, as discussed in Ref. [33]. Our results further suggest that thermoosmotic flows along solid-liquid interfaces may contribute considerably to thermophoretic measurements in thin film geometries and may be harnessed for microfluidic applications.},

However, the optothermal temperature field was merely employed for in-situ manipulation of nanoparticles, its potential for identifying bio-nanoparticles remains largely untapped. Hence, based on the synergistic effect of optothermal manipulation and CRIPSR-based bio-detection, we developed CRISPR-powered optothermal nanotweezers (CRONT). Specifically, by harnessing diffusiophoresis and thermo-osmotic flows near the substrate upon optothermal excitation, we successfully trapped and enriched DNA functionalized gold nanoparticles, CRISPR-associated proteins, as well as DNA strands. Remarkably, we built an optothermal scheme for enhancing CRISPR-based single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection at single molecule level, while also introducing a novel CRISPR methodology for observing nucleotide cleavage. Therefore, this innovative approach has endowed optical tweezers with DNA identification ability in aqueous solution which was unattainable before. With its high specificity and feasibility for insitu bio-nanoparticle manipulation and identification, CRONT will become a universal tool in point-of-care diagnosis, biophotonics, and bio-nanotechnology.},

First, we investigate the particle trapping near a non-absorbing reflective surface to understand the action of the optical force of annular beam. The results show that the optical force cannot trap the particles near a reflective surface. Second, an annular beam is generated by Gaussian beam shaping with the aid of axicons, which is then used to irradiate and heat a gold film to create an optothermal trap. The induced thermal gradient and thermal convection can bind the particles in the center of the annular spot. The trapping stiffness of the optothermal trap is 8.1 ± 2.9 fN/μm at a laser power of 100 mW.},

We find reduced accumulation for decreased surface temperature gradients and enhanced salt concentrations. Moreover, thermophoretic fluid dynamics calculations predict flat accumulation profiles with 107-fold enhanced concentrations that are consistent with our experiments.

  abstract = {Molecules drift along temperature gradients, an effect called thermophoresis, the Soret effect, or thermodiffusion. In liquids, its theoretical foundation is the subject of a long-standing debate. By using an all-optical microfluidic fluorescence method, we present experimental results for DNA and polystyrene beads over a large range of particle sizes, salt concentrations, and temperatures. The data support a unifying theory based on solvation entropy. Stated in simple terms, the Soret coefficient is given by the negative solvation entropy, divided by               kT               . The theory predicts the thermodiffusion of polystyrene beads and DNA without any free parameters. We assume a local thermodynamic equilibrium of the solvent molecules around the molecule. This assumption is fulfilled for moderate temperature gradients below a fluctuation criterion. For both DNA and polystyrene beads, thermophoretic motion changes sign at lower temperatures. This thermophilicity toward lower temperatures is attributed to an increasing positive entropy of hydration, whereas the generally dominating thermophobicity is explained by the negative entropy of ionic shielding. The understanding of thermodiffusion sets the stage for detailed probing of solvation properties of colloids and biomolecules. For example, we successfully determine the effective charge of DNA and beads over a size range that is not accessible with electrophoresis.},

Here, we show that hydrodynamic boundary flows enable the trapping and manipulation of nano-objects near surfaces. We trigger thermo-osmotic flows by modulating the van der Waals and double layer interactions at a gold-liquid interface with optically generated local temperature fields. The hydrodynamic flows, attractive van der Waals and repulsive double layer forces acting on the suspended nanoparticles enable precise nanoparticle positioning and guidance. A rapid multiplexing of flow fields permits the parallel manipulation of many nano-objects and the generation of complex flow fields. Our findings have direct implications for the field of plasmonic nanotweezers and other thermo-plasmonic trapping systems, paving the way for nanoscopic manipulation with boundary flows.},

Treating colloidal particles as building blocks, researchers are exploiting new strategies to rationally organize colloidal particles into complex structures for new functions and devices. Despite tremendous progress in directed assembly and self-assembly, a truly versatile assembly technique without specific functionalization of the colloidal particles remains elusive. We develop a new strategy to assemble colloidal matter under a light-controlled temperature field, which can solve challenges in the existing assembly techniques. By adding an anionic surfactant (that is, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride), which serves as a surface charge source, a macro ion, and a micellar depletant, we generate a light-controlled thermoelectric field to manipulate colloidal atoms and a depletion attraction force to assemble the colloidal atoms into two-dimensional (2D) colloidal matter. The general applicability of this opto-thermophoretic assembly (OTA) strategy allows us to build colloidal matter of diverse colloidal sizes (from subwavelength scale to micrometer scale) and materials (polymeric, dielectric, and metallic colloids) with versatile configurations and tunable bonding strengths and lengths. We further demonstrate that the incorporation of the thermoelectric field into the optical radiation force can achieve 3D reconfiguration of the colloidal matter. The OTA strategy releases the rigorous design rules required in the existing assembly techniques and enriches the structural complexity in colloidal matter, which will open a new window of opportunities for basic research on matter organization, advanced material design, and applications.},

However, the high laser power involved in optical trapping can damage biological samples. In this context, indirect trapping of microparticles and objects using fluid flow fields has assumed great importance. It has recently been shown that cells and particles can be turned in the pitch sense by opto-plasmonic heating of a gold surface constituting one side of a sample chamber. We extend that work to place two such hotspots in close proximity to each other to form a very unique configuration of flow fields forming an effective quasi-three-dimensional ‘trap’, assisted by thermophoresis. This is effectively a harmonic trap confining particles in all three dimensions without relying on other factors to confine the particles close to the surface. We use this to show indirect trapping of different types of upconverting particles and cells, and also show that we can approach a trap stiffness of 40 fN μm−1 indicating a weak confinement regime without relying on feedback.},

Akin to other driven transport processes, such as the Soret effect in simple fluid mixtures, or electrophoresis and diffusiophoresis in colloidal suspensions, it is, both experimentally and theoretically, a challenging subject. Rather than being a comprehensive recollection, this review aims to be a critical re-examination of the experimental and theoretical tools used to investigate thermophoresis, and of some recent relevant results that may unravel novel aspects of colloid solvation forces. The perspectives of thermophoresis as a tool for particle manipulation in microfluidics are also emphasized.},

The heat flow is induced by localized absorption of laser light by a cluster of single walled carbon nanotubes, with no requirement for a treated substrate.

They are commonly formed by a drying process that is assisted by capillary forces at the drying fronts. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the optically induced dynamic thermofluidic assembly of 2D and 3D colloidal crystals. We quantify in experiment and simulation the structure formation and identify thermo-osmosis and temperature induced depletion interactions as the key contributors to the colloidal crystal formation. The non-equilibrium nature of the assembly of colloidal crystals and its dynamic control by laser-induced local heating promise new possibilities for a versatile formation of photonic structures inaccessible by equilibrium processes.},

  abstract = {Controlled assembly of functional structures that can be dynamically reconfigured remains a significant challenge in materials science. Here, we demonstrate a nonequilibrium assembly approach where colloidal particles organize into threedimensional crystalline structures through the interplay of three temperature-induced phenomena: thermophoresis, thermoosmosis, and depletion forces from polyethylene glycol molecules. Using precisely controlled laser-induced temperature gradients, we assemble highly ordered colloidal crystals within minutes, significantly faster than conventional equilibrium approaches. These structures exhibit tunable photonic stopbands that can be modulated by adjusting the laser power, causing structural transitions between crystalline and toroidal configurations. By quantifying the underlying particle fluxes and growth dynamics, we develop a model that accurately predicts assembly rates across different conditions. Our thermofluidic assembly approach offers a versatile platform for creating reconfigurable functional materials with dynamically tunable properties, circumventing limitations of traditional equilibrium assembly methods.},

  abstract = {Using colloids effectively confined in two dimensions by a cell with a thickness comparable to the particle size, we investigate the nucleation and growth of crystallites induced by locally heating the solvent with a near-infrared laser beam. The particles, which are “thermophilic,” move towards the laser spot solely because of thermophoresis with no convection effects, forming dense clusters whose structure is monitored using two order parameters that gauge the local density and the orientational ordering. We find that ordering takes place when the cluster reaches an average surface density that is still below the upper equilibrium limit for the fluid phase of hard disks, meaning that we do not detect any sign of a proper “two-stage” nucleation from a glass or a polymorphic crystal structure. The crystal obtained at late growth stage displays a remarkable uniformity with a negligible amount of defects, arguably because the incoming particles diffuse, bounce, and displace other particles before settling at the crystal interface. This “fluidization” of the outer crystal edge may resemble the surface enhanced mobility giving rise to ultra-stable glasses by physical vapor deposition.},

The temperature increase is triggered by photothermal effects of fluids and/or boundaries due to the absorption of a focused Gaussian beam irradiated perpendicular to the fluid film, and then the temperature variation induces the flow fields through a buoyancy force and/or thermo-osmotic slip. The semianalytical solution to this optothermal fluidic system is validated by comparing with the results of numerical simulation, and is applied to typical optothermal fluidic problems. In particular, the optothermal trap of nanoparticles observed in our previous experiment [Tsuji  , ] is investigated in terms of thermophoretic force and flow drag that are obtained semianalytically. The semianalytical solution can be shared through open-source codes that are available to researchers without the background of fluid mechanics.

  abstract = {In this paper, thermal-slip coefficients in slip boundary conditions of the Stokes equation~are derived using the generalized slip-flow theory, with special interest in the role of near-wall potential in micro- and nanoscale flows. As the model of fluids and fluid-solid interaction, we employ the model Boltzmann equation~for dilute gases and the diffuse-reflection boundaries with near-wall potential, respectively. It is found that, when the mean free path of gas molecules and the effective range of potential are of the same order of magnitude, the thermal-slip boundary condition can be derived in the near-continuum limit. In the derived slip-flow theory, the thermal-slip coefficient and the boundary-layer corrections (i.e., Knudsen-layer corrections) are determined by solving the kinetic boundary-layer problems (i.e., Knudsen-layer problems) that include external- force terms and inhomogeneous terms both driven by the potential. As an application of the slip-flow theory, thermo-osmosis between two parallel plates with uniform temperature gradients is analyzed. The results of the slip-flow theory are validated by comparing them with those of the direct numerical analysis of the same problem. Furthermore, it is found that thermo-osmosis and thermal slip on the plates are significantly affected by the features of the near-wall potential; even the gas-flow direction can be reversed when the near-wall potential is repulsive. Such a flow reversal is qualitatively similar to thermo-osmosis in liquids reported in existing molecular dynamics simulation.},

In this work, we study the transverse forces of an optothermal trap in front of a gold film, which is an absorbing reflective surface for the incident laser beam. It is demonstrated that optothermal forces can be divided into two parts: optical force of a standing-wave trap, and thermal force of a thermal trap. The optical force of the standing-wave trap can be obtained by measuring the optical trapping force close to a non-absorbing film with same reflectance. The thermal force can be obtained by subtracting the optical force of the standing-wave trap from the total trapping force of the optothermal trap close to the gold film. The results show that both optical and thermal trapping forces increase with laser power increasing. The optical trapping force is larger than the thermal trapping force, which is composed of convective drag force and thermophoretic force. Further experiment is run to study the composition of thermal force. The result shows that the convective flow is generated later than the thermophoretic flow. The results proposed here are useful for enabling users to optimize optothermal manipulation method for future applications.},

We discuss different transport mechanisms for charged colloids, and how a thermal gradient gives rise to companion fields. Particular emphasis is put on the thermal response of the electrolyte solution: positive and negative ions diffuse along the temperature gradient and thus induce a thermoelectric field which in turn acts on the colloidal charges. Regarding polymers in organic solvents, the physical mechanism changes with decreasing molecular weight: high polymers are described in the framework of macroscopic hydrodynamics; for short chains and molecular mixtures of similar size, the Brownian motion of solute and solvent becomes important.},
